		<p>
			This is one of my first projects in Moringa school. It is a simple webpage that explores the use of haedings to and how they are displayed on a webpage and how to work with the Linux terminal commands to push your projects from the local repository using git to the remote repository on Github for storage.
		</p>
		<a href="https://github.com/Peter-cloud-web/Working-with-Branches">Working with Branches Project</a>
		<p>
			This project comprises of ways one can use github resources to create pages that may used while working on a project.Github pages work in such a way it helps a developer organise his work especially where teams are involved where diffrent developers work on diffrent parts of a project on diffrent git pages then merge them to a master branch after the project is perfect with no bugs.
		</p>

			This is a project the involves folking of other people projects from their remote Github repository to your remote Github repository and cloning to your local repository which is your local machine's storage. This is a process that is specially done to a project you want contribute it. May be if you want add some HTML, CSS or javascript to make it better or improve it then pushing it to your Github repository where you get to request the owner to pull it to his/her Github account and check out the improvements you've done into it.
